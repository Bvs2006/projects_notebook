    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to **Novel Therapeutic Modalities**, which is a very exciting and rapidly expanding area in drug discovery. Instead of relying solely on traditional small molecules or antibodies, this development focuses on **entirely new ways to interact with biological systems to treat diseases.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into the key components of this development:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. CRISPR and Gene Editing Therapies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary gene-editing technology that allows scientists to precisely cut and modify DNA. It's often described as a \"molecular scissors.\"\n",
      "*   **How it's used in drug discovery:**\n",
      "    *   **Correcting Genetic Defects:** For inherited diseases caused by a faulty gene (e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia), CRISPR can potentially edit the DNA to fix the mutation, offering a one-time cure rather than lifelong treatment.\n",
      "    *   **Disabling Disease-Causing Genes:** In diseases where a gene's overactivity contributes to the problem (e.g., certain cancers), CRISPR can be used to \"turn off\" or disable that gene.\n",
      "    *   **Introducing Protective Genes:** In some cases, CRISPR might be used to introduce a new, functional copy of a gene.\n",
      "*   **Latest Developments:** Several clinical trials are underway for conditions like sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, showing promising results. Research is also expanding into treating cancers and infectious diseases.\n",
      "*   **Challenges:** Off-target edits (unintended DNA changes), delivery of CRISPR components to the right cells, and ethical considerations are still areas of active research and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. RNA-based Therapeutics (mRNA, siRNA, ASOs):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** These therapies utilize RNA molecules to influence gene expression.\n",
      "    *   **mRNA (messenger RNA):** Carries instructions from DNA to the cell's machinery (ribosomes) to build proteins. In vaccines, it teaches cells to make a specific protein (like a viral spike protein). In therapeutics, it can instruct cells to make a missing or deficient protein, or even a therapeutic protein.\n",
      "    *   **siRNA (small interfering RNA) & ASOs (Antisense Oligonucleotides):** These are short RNA strands designed to bind to specific mRNA molecules and either degrade them (siRNA) or block their translation into protein (ASOs). This is useful for \"silencing\" genes that are causing disease.\n",
      "*   **How it's used in drug discovery:**\n",
      "    *   **Treating Genetic Disorders:** For diseases caused by a protein deficiency, mRNA can be used to deliver the instructions for making that protein. For diseases caused by an overactive or toxic protein, siRNA or ASOs can be used to reduce its production.\n",
      "    *   **Cancer Therapy:** RNA can be used to stimulate the immune system against cancer or to target specific cancer-promoting genes.\n",
      "    *   **Infectious Diseases:** Similar to vaccines, mRNA can be used to trigger an immune response against pathogens.\n",
      "*   **Latest Developments:** The success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has accelerated research and investment in mRNA therapeutics for a much broader range of diseases. siRNA and ASO therapies are already approved for certain rare genetic conditions.\n",
      "*   **Challenges:** Delivering RNA molecules to target cells efficiently and ensuring their stability in the body are key areas of development.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Peptide Therapeutics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Peptides are short chains of amino acids, smaller than proteins. They are naturally occurring in the body and have diverse biological functions.\n",
      "*   **How it's used in drug discovery:**\n",
      "    *   **Mimicking Natural Hormones:** Many hormones are peptides (e.g., insulin, glucagon). Peptide therapeutics can be designed to mimic or modulate the action of these hormones.\n",
      "    *   **Targeting Receptors:** Peptides can be engineered to bind to specific cell surface receptors, triggering or blocking certain cellular responses.\n",
      "    *   **Antimicrobial Peptides:** Some peptides have natural antimicrobial properties and are being explored as new antibiotics.\n",
      "*   **Latest Developments:** AI is proving very effective in designing novel peptides with improved stability, potency, and targeted delivery. Advances in peptide synthesis and delivery methods are making them more viable as therapeutic options.\n",
      "*   **Challenges:** Peptides can be prone to degradation in the body and may have short half-lives. Developing delivery systems that ensure they reach their target effectively is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** ADCs are a sophisticated class of drugs that combine the precision of antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic drugs (chemotherapy).\n",
      "*   **How it's used in drug discovery:**\n",
      "    *   **Targeted Cancer Therapy:** An antibody is designed to recognize a specific protein marker found on the surface of cancer cells but not on healthy cells. This antibody is then linked to a powerful chemotherapy drug. When the antibody binds to the cancer cell, the ADC is internalized, and the chemotherapy drug is released specifically within the cancer cell, minimizing damage to healthy tissues.\n",
      "*   **Latest Developments:** Several ADCs have been approved and are highly effective treatments for various cancers (e.g., breast cancer, lymphoma). The field is rapidly evolving with new antibody targets, linker technologies, and payload chemistries being developed.\n",
      "*   **Challenges:** Resistance mechanisms can develop in cancer cells. Optimizing the antibody, linker, and drug combination is complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this a \"Development\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "These modalities represent a shift in how we approach treating disease. Instead of just looking for small molecules that can fit into a protein's active site, we are now able to:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Directly alter genetic code.**\n",
      "*   **Precisely control protein production.**\n",
      "*   **Engineer biological messengers.**\n",
      "*   **Deliver potent toxins directly to diseased cells.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This diversification of therapeutic tools significantly expands the range of diseases that can be targeted and the ways in which they can be treated, offering more precise, effective, and potentially curative options.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
    "3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n"
